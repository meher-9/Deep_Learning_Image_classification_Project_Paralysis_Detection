->Facial Paralysis Detection:

This project implements a Facial Paralysis Detection system using Python and relevant libraries for machine learning and computer vision.

->Project Structure:

- 'facial_paralysis_detection.ipynb' - Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the detection pipeline.

-> Features:

- Data preprocessing for facial images
- Facial landmarks extraction
- Model training and evaluation
- Predictions for detecting signs of facial paralysis

-> Requirements:

Make sure to install the following dependencies before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow
```

->Usage:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook facial_paralysis_detection.ipynb
   ```
2. Run all cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and perform predictions.

-> Output:

- The notebook outputs prediction results, accuracy scores, and visualizations for facial features.

->Notes:

- Ensure you have a working webcam or a dataset of facial images.
- Model accuracy may vary based on dataset quality and size.
