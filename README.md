# Deep_Learning_Image_classification_Project_Paralysis_Detection
This project aims to detect facial paralysis using deep learning and image classification techniques. A pretrained VGG16 model was fine-tuned through transfer learning to classify facial images as stroke-affected or normal. The model was trained, evaluated, and deployed to assist in early medical diagnosis and decision-making.
